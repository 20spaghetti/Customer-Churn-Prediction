Given a dataset of unlabeled information, the aim of this project was to identify predictors of customers cancelling their insurance products (customer churn). I combined exploratory methods including summary statistics and graphical analysis to identify issues with class imbalance in the response variable and important variable candidates. Chi-square tests and p-value analysis of regression coefficients were used to further understand important variables, it was determined that linear models would be sufficient for solving the problem. Regression and discriminant models were evaluated using measures of sensitivity, specificity, bootstrap standard error of coefficients while accounting for model flexibility, complexity and interpretability. <br><br>
