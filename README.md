The aim here is to build a statistical model which will accurately predict when an insurance company is about to lose their customer. There are sixteen anonymized features in the dataset and one response variable (named 'labels') which indicates churn (1) or no churn (0) for each observation. Two datasets are provided for training (trainSet.csv) and testing (testSet.csv) the models. <br><br>
